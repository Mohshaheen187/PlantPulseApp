# Plant Watering System

## Overview

The Plant Watering System is an automated solution designed to monitor and regulate the moisture levels of the soil to ensure optimal conditions for plant growth. This project utilizes an ESP32 microcontroller and various sensors to achieve efficient and automated watering.

## Components

### 1. ESP32

The ESP32 serves as the brain of the system, managing sensor data and controlling the watering mechanism based on predefined conditions.

### 2. Soil Moisture Sensor

This sensor measures the moisture content in the soil, providing crucial data for determining when to water the plants.

### 3. Watering Mechanism

The watering mechanism, controlled by the ESP32, delivers water to the soil when the moisture levels fall below a specified threshold.

## Benefits and Advantages

### 1. Water Conservation

The Plant Watering System optimizes water usage by only watering the plants when necessary. This not only promotes water conservation but also prevents overwatering, a common cause of plant issues.

### 2. Plant Health Monitoring

With real-time soil moisture data, the system enables you to monitor the health of your plants. Early detection of moisture imbalances allows for timely intervention, ensuring your plants thrive.

### 3. User-Friendly Application

The accompanying PlantPulseApp provides an intuitive interface for users to monitor and control the system. Easily adjust watering schedules, view historical data, and receive alerts, all from the convenience of your device.

### 4. Customizable Settings

Tailor the watering system to your specific plant needs by adjusting parameters such as moisture threshold and watering duration using PlantPulseApp. The system's flexibility allows for adaptation to different plant types and environmental conditions.

### 5. Remote Access and Notifications

The system keeps you informed wherever you are. Receive notifications on your mobile device when the soil moisture deviates from the desired range, and remotely control the watering system through the PlantPulseApp.
