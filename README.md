## Components

### 1. ESP32

The ESP32 serves as the brain of the system, managing sensor data and controlling the watering mechanism based on predefined conditions.

### 2. Soil Moisture Sensor

This sensor measures the moisture content in the soil, providing crucial data for determining when to water the plants.

### 3. Watering Mechanism

The watering mechanism, controlled by the ESP32, delivers water to the soil when the moisture levels fall below a specified threshold.
